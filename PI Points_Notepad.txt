PI Points:

Don't s::
Don't Arrive Late: Punctuality is crucial and arriving late can create a negative impression.
Don't Badmouth Previous Employers: Refrain from speaking negatively about former employers or colleagues, as it reflects poorly on your professionalism.
Avoid Overconfidence: While confidence is important, avoid coming across as arrogant or overly confident.
Don't Ramble: Keep your responses concise and to the point. Rambling can make it difficult for the interviewer to follow your train of thought.
Don't Interrupt: Allow the interviewer to finish speaking before responding. Interrupting can be perceived as rude and disrespectful.
Avoid Negative Body Language: Maintain good posture, avoid fidgeting, and refrain from crossing your arms, as these can convey nervousness or disinterest.
Don't Lie: Be honest about your qualifications, experiences, and skills. Lying can easily be detected and may jeopardize your chances of getting hired.

Do's:

Good Posture: Sit up straight with your shoulders back. This posture exudes confidence and attentiveness.

Fidgeting(Padapadapu): Avoid excessive fidgeting, such as tapping your feet or playing with your hair, as it can indicate nervousness or lack of focus.
Avoiding Eye Contact: Failing to make eye contact may suggest dishonesty or lack of confidence. Make sure to maintain appropriate eye contact throughout the interview.
